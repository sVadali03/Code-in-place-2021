"""
This program highlights fires in an image by identifying pixels
whose red intensity is more than INTENSITY_THRESHOLD times the
average of the red, green, and blue values at a pixel. Those
"sufficiently red" pixels are then highlighted in the image
and other pixels are turned grey, by setting the pixel red,
green, and blue values to be all the same average value.
