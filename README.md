# Code-in-place-2021
CS106A is one of most popular courses at Stanford University. Code in Place was first offered right when the COVID-19 global lock down started. The course teaches the fundamentals of computer programming using the widely-used Python programming language. This course is for everyone from humanists, social scientists, to hardcore engineers. Code in Place is built off the first half of CS106A.
